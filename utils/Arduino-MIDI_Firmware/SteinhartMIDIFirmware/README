1. What	is Moco, anyway ?
  This is a native MIDI firmware for atmega8u2 on Arcuino Uno.
  You can replace original USB-to-serial firmware with Moco. This driver will bridge between USB-MIDI and serial-MIDI.
  (1) The host will recognize Arduino Uno as USB-MIDI device without any driver on MacOSX and Windows XP.
  (2) You need to write original USB-to-serial firmware back to 8u2 for the reprogramming of main CPU .(atmega328)

NOTE: The original Mico/Moco is a software for USB-MIDI bridge with V-USB.

2. Requirements
(1) gcc 4.X for compile
   I use CrossPack in OSX.
 (2) LUFA101122 to compile & link
 (3) Arduino UNO
  I recommend to add ICSP connector for atmega 8u2
 (4) AVR programmer like USBtinyISP
  DFU Programmer should also work, but not tested.

3. Specifications
 (1) Bi-directional USB-MIDI to Serial-MIDI bridge.
 (2) baud rate for serial MIDI is 312500Hz (standard)

4. Applications
I use PSG Shield designed by Genie-san and HKHacks-san.
